# react-ai-ui

A simple chatbot that uses React and the Vercel AI SDK to perform RAG.
Specifically, you can ask this bot questions about:
- Any GitHub user
- The list of repositories of any GitHub user
- Any GitHub repo (given its owner and name)

When the chatbot makes a call to the GitHub API, it will answer using a React component, while other questions will be answered by text.
